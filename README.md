### Task Description: LearnHub – Interactive E-Learning Platform

The project involved creating a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly e-learning platform called **LearnHub** using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (Vanilla)**. This application aims to provide a simplified version of an online learning system. Users can browse available courses, filter content by interest, enroll in selected courses, monitor their learning progress, and switch between light and dark modes for a personalized experience.

The platform is designed as a **front-end only** web application, which means it does not require a backend server or external database. Instead, it uses **LocalStorage** for data storage, ensuring that user preferences and progress are saved across sessions. The project emphasizes a clean user interface, interactivity, and real-time feedback through JavaScript-based DOM manipulation and visual effects.

### Tools and Technologies Used

**Languages and Libraries:**

* **HTML5:** Provides the structural foundation of the application, ensuring a semantic layout with elements like `nav`, `section`, `header`, and `footer`.
* **CSS3:** Used for styling, layout, and responsiveness. It employs CSS variables, media queries for mobile responsiveness, and transition effects for smooth animations.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Drives the interactive features of the application, including dynamic course rendering, filtering, theme switching, LocalStorage data management, and event-driven updates for UI components.

**Editor Platform:**

* The application was developed and tested using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, a popular integrated development environment. Features like Live Server, Emmet abbreviations, and the built-in terminal were crucial for testing and debugging throughout development.

### Key Functionalities

1. **Navigation Bar:**
   The fixed navigation bar offers easy access to different sections of the site, including Home, Courses, My Courses, and Course Details. A toggle button allows switching between dark and light modes, and the selected theme is saved using LocalStorage.

2. **Home Section:**
   Introduces users to the platform with a heading and subheading that convey the site's purpose and tone.

3. **Courses Section:**
   Displays a list of available courses that users can search and filter by category. Users can enter keywords or select predefined categories (Web Development, Python, Data Science) to narrow their search. The filtering and rendering of course cards is entirely handled by JavaScript.

4. **Enrollment System:**
   Each course card has an "Enroll" button. When clicked, the course is saved in the browser's LocalStorage, and a brief toast notification confirms successful enrollment. The system checks existing records to prevent duplicate enrollments.

5. **My Courses Section:**
   Shows all courses the user has enrolled in. The list is dynamically created from LocalStorage, maintaining state even after page reloads.

6. **Course Detail Section:**
   Simulates a real course detail page with a brief description of the course, an embedded YouTube video (as a sample lecture), and a progress tracker. A button labeled "Mark Lesson Complete" allows users to simulate lesson completion, updating the progress bar. The progress is saved in LocalStorage.

7. **Dark/Light Mode:**
   Users can toggle the site's appearance using the theme switcher. The theme preference is stored in LocalStorage, ensuring the chosen appearance is preserved during visits.

8. **Toast Notifications:**
   When enrolling in a course, a small pop-up notification appears in the corner of the screen. This is managed with JavaScript and styled using CSS, improving user interaction feedback without using alert boxes or page reloads.

### Applicability

This project can be applied in various academic, professional, and personal settings:

* **Academic Projects:** Ideal for demonstrating front-end development skills in college projects or bootcamp portfolios.
* **Portfolio Presentation:** Shows the ability to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a real-world inspired application.
* **Prototype for Startups:** Works as a basic prototype for an ed-tech idea that needs minimal setup and no backend.
* **Teaching Tool:** A useful educational resource for teaching beginners about LocalStorage, DOM manipulation, and UI responsiveness.
* **Internship Submissions:** A strong project for internship applications, particularly for front-end roles, highlighting a focus on usability and design.

### Conclusion

LearnHub is a well-organized e-learning platform built using essential web development technologies. It balances simplicity and functionality by providing a clean interface, responsive layout, interactive components, and data persistence through browser storage. With no external dependencies or frameworks, the platform remains lightweight and easy to maintain. It effectively fulfills the requirements of a front-end based learning management system prototype.
